# Code Debugger with LangChain and Llama3

This is a Python code debugging tool using LangChain and the Llama3 model (via Ollama) for analyzing code and suggesting improvements.

## Features

- **Syntax Checking**: Detects syntax errors using Python's `ast` library.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Uses Llama3 to suggest code improvements beyond syntax.





## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

- Enter your Python code when prompted.
- The tool first checks syntax; if no issues, it performs advanced analysis with Llama3.
