print Ahmet,"The following syntax issues were found:
Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)? (<unknown>, line 1)","I'm happy to help!

The given code is likely an error, as `print Ahmet` should be a string literal enclosed in quotes. Here's the corrected code:

```
print(""Ahmet"")
```

Alternatively, if `Ahmet` is a variable or constant defined elsewhere in the program, you can use that variable directly:

```
print(Ahmet)
```

If it's not defined, consider adding a declaration statement (e.g., `name = ""Ahmet""`).",No specific solution available. Please check your code for potential issues.,,,2024-10-07 10:40:15.285030
