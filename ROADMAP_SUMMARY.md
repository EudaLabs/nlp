## üöÄ Top 5 Immediate Actions

### 1. Testing Infrastructure (Week 1)
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
# Create pytest.ini and tests/
# Write first tests
```
**Why:** Foundation for quality code

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (Week 1)
```bash
# Create .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Add automated testing
# Add linting
```
**Why:** Catch bugs early, automate checks

### 3. BERT Classification (Week 2)
```python
# Fine-tune BERT for text classification
# Add training and inference scripts
# Create tutorial notebook
```
**Why:** Most popular transformer, high learning value

### 4. FastAPI Deployment (Week 2)
```python
# Create REST API for model serving
# Add Docker containerization
# Document API endpoints
```
**Why:** Bridge to production

### 5. Documentation (Week 3)
```markdown
# Improve existing project READMEs
# Add usage examples
# Create tutorials
```
**Why:** Make projects accessible
