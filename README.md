# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

This repository contains a collection of projects I have developed while learning and experimenting with various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Each project demonstrates different aspects of NLP using Python and related libraries.

## Technologies
This repository currently leverages the following technologies, with plans to include more in future projects:
- **Python 3.12**
- **NLP libraries in use:**
  - SpaCy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - NLTK
  - Gensim
- **Other libraries:**
  - LangChain
  - Gradio
- **Planned for future use:**
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - Other deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow for advanced models
- **Supporting libraries:**
  - NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation

Each project folder contains:
- A detailed explanation in the README file of the project folder.
- Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to run the project.
