The Amazon rainforest, also known as Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest 
in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin

The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, 
followed by Peru with 13%, and Colombia with 10%.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to 
natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined 
as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives 
its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. 
The term "artificial intelligence" was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy.

The Apollo 11 mission was the first spaceflight that landed humans on the Moon.

    Ask questions about any text and get answers extracted from the context.
    
    **How it works:**
    1. Provide a context (a paragraph or article)
    2. Ask a question about the context
    3. The model finds and extracts the answer
    
    **Note:** The answer must be present in the context. This is extractive QA, 
    not generative - it finds existing text rather than creating new answers.
